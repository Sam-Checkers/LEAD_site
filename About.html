    <div class="About_content">
        <p>For over 30 years, LEAD facilitators have invested in the development of people in their communities and around the world. <br>
        These experiences have enhanced our understanding of the importance and challenges of leadership as well as personal and organization effectiveness <br>
    We view each engagement as an opportunity to share what we have learned from others and to keep learning.</p>

        <p>At LEAD, there is no typical training engagement. Every organization and individual provides a unique opportunity to learn together.</p>
