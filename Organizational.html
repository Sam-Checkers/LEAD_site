        <li>Our relationship starts with a conversation so we can understand your needs and determine how we can help. <br>

            Creating the foundation of your training program starts with selecting the right content and delivery format. <br>
            Together, we determine the most effective package from our LEAD Academy online courses, virtual and in-person workshops, group coaching sessions, and learning projects.<br>
            Our training content is research-based with an emphasis on practical applications and learning from your experiences.<br>
            The content continues to be refined through interactions with a variety of global audiences. Let's learn together.

            Designing the framework of your training program requires determing the leader's optimal level of involvement and the best rhythm for coaching sessions and learning assignments.<br>
            If the leadership team wants to lead the sessions, we will make that happen. If it works better for us to facilitate and coach, we are ready to play that role.<br>
            Let's get the regular work done and still make training a priority.
        </li>
        <li>
            Finally, we invest in everyone involved in making the training successful, so they are confident in their roles.<br>
            We recognize the journey requires flexibility and perseverance to meet the expected and unexpected challenges. Let's journey together.
